# Credit Card Comparer
This project exists to determine the very best credit card for some reason
this sort of project does not exist anywhere and so I decided to build it.
A few things to note. I am not bothering with stupid aeroplan cards. They are
to hard to actually compare. Another thing, I am only comparing canadian
credit cards... Because I am a damn canadian. And the last thing I won't
be comparing all cards, only the ones that I can qualify for, so no amex
blacks will be here. Since I don't make crazy amounts of money and am poooor.

That is all you really need to know.
## Data source

All the data currently comes from
[this](https://www.rewardscanada.ca/compare-credit-cards/all-cash-back-cards.html)
site.

## Why Clojure
I was considering just using javascript for this since it scrapes data but
i wanted to explore using something different. A lisp-like language that
uses the jvm and with clojurescript can even sort of get it to run in the
browser. I have wanted a reason to use clojure for a while because I have
heard how good it is for improving the way you program and the parsimony of
its syntax.  So here I am, trying to write my first program in clojure. Not
even going to bother with doing hello-world.

Clojure is a language I heard is quite good at doing data analysis, and this
is to test that. I had the opportunity to use python, but yeah, not a huge
fan of python so I am trying to see if something else can be better. Like
python, it is dynamic, and has a repl.  Unlike python it has a reasonable
way to separate clauses, '\s' and '()', not '\s\s\s\s' or ':\n'.
